# SudBread
Finds all solutions to Sudoku puzzles using the breadcrumb method.

This is an old project which finds every possible solution to a given Sudoku puzzle. It is being updated to be not 
terrible and to evaluate the usage of CLion.

This repository also includes the required project files to work on the project with CLion (https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/).
